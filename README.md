# hugo-starter

This repository contains a "getting started" Hugo website and is associated with the following blog posts, which walk
through the code file by file, and provide an introduction to Hugo that's hard to get from the official documentation.

- Getting Started with Hugo, Part 1: https://steelyard.io/posts/getting-started-with-hugo/
- Getting Started with Hugo, Part 2: coming soon

### Running the Website Locally

After cloning the repo:

1. Install Hugo, if you haven't already.

```
$ brew install hugo
```

2. Run Hugo in dev mode (live reload is enabled, so changes appear automatically).

```
$ cd hugo-starter
$ hugo serve
```

3. Point your browser to localhost:1313.

That's it. You should see the website described in the blog posts.
